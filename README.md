Tweet Sentiment Analysis using CountVectorizer and TF-IDF with Logistic Regression in Python.

# Tweet Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets using Natural Language Processing techniques.
The goal is to compare the performance of **CountVectorizer** and **TF-IDF Vectorizer** when used
with **Logistic Regression** for multi-class sentiment classification.

## Features
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization)
- Feature extraction using CountVectorizer and TF-IDF
- Logistic Regression classifier
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
- Visual comparison of model results

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Conclusion
TF-IDF Vectorizer achieved better performance compared to CountVectorizer by reducing the impact
of frequently occurring but less meaningful words.
